tf2_inv.py
----------

annoying_ahk
------------
Series of annoying AutoHotkey scripts for Windows.

1. annoying1 - Fills the screen with popups, additionally making DWM and the process consume RAM.
2. annoying2 - Moves around the screen randomly every 10 seconds. If the user clicks on the window, it moves.
3. annoying3 - Grows a window until it fills the entire screen. Also constantly takes focus, makes computer unusable until it's done.
4. annoying3_evil - Same as annoying3, except that it never stops. Usually takes a reboot to get back to normal.
5. annoying4 - Moves mouse, clicks, or types random characters at random intervals. I don't think this one works ATM, but I could be wrong.
